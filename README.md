# ♻️ Wastify

Wastify is an Android application that helps users identify whether waste is **organic** or **recyclable** using AI-powered image classification. By simply taking a photo, users can make better disposal decisions and contribute to a cleaner environment.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 **AI Waste Scanner**  
  Open your phone’s camera, take a photo of waste, and let our AI model classify it as **organic** or **recyclable**.

- 🕘 **Scan History**  
  View all previous scans along with their classification results for easy tracking.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User captures an image using the in-app camera  
2. Image is processed by a **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** model  
3. Model predicts the waste category  
4. Result is displayed and saved to scan history
